# Introduction

ActorScript is a new, general purpose programming language for the
Dfinity platform.

## Why a new language?

Dfinity has chosen WebAssembly as its low-level virtual machine. 

The currently
available compilers targeting WebAssembly are for languages that are
either too unsafe (C, C++) or too complex (Rust) for mainstream
programmers. 

To promote correctness and reduce complexity, Dfinity is designing its own language, *ActorScript*, that is safe and expressive, yet simple and approachable to mainstream programmers.

### Interoperability

ActorScript is just one of hopefully many languages able to run on the Dfinity platform. 

Since WebAssembly is language agnostic and, unlike other virtual machines, does not mandate a high-level type system for language interoperation, Dfinity will provide an *Interface Definition Language* to support typed, cross-language communication.

The ActorScript compiler will automate the production and consumption of IDL files, driven by type signatures ActorScript programs and the structure of imported IDL interfaces.

The IDL language is currently under design and outside the scope of this document.


## Design Goals

ActorScript provides:

* A high-level language for programming Dfinity applications

* A simple ("K.I.S.S.") design and familiar syntax for average programmers

* Good and convenient support for the actor model embodied in Dfinity conisters

* A good fit for underlying Wasm and Dfinity execution model

* A forward looking design that anticipates future extensions to WebAssembly

## Key Features

The key language features of ActorScript are:

* JavaScript/TypeScript-style syntax.

* Automatic memory management (by precise garbage collection).

* Strong, static typing with parametric polymorphism, subtype polymorphism and 
  structural typing.

* Unbounded and bounded numeric types with explicit conversions
  between them. Bounded numeric types are overflow-checked.

* Imperative programming features such a mutable variables and arrays
  and flexible, local control flow constructs (`return`, `break` and `continue`).

* Functions (and messages) are first-class values, argument evaluation
  is strict (call-by-value).

* Pattern matching on scalar and compound values.

* A simple, class-based object system without inheritance.

* The value of a reference can never implicitly be `null`,
  preventing a large class of `null`-reference failures.
  Instead, an explicitly handled, possibly `null`, *option type* `?<type>` is provided.
   
* Classes can be actors (canisters).

* An Actor based concurrency model:

  * Actor state is isolated.

  * All communication with and between actors is by message passing (never through shared state).

  * An actor's messages are processed in sequence, so state modifications are
     always data-race free.

* Message passing is asynchronous (to hide network lacency).

* A familiar `async`/`await` constructs enables sequential programming with asynchronous messaging.

Like most programming lanuages, ActorScript borrows features from others and
draws inspirations from Java, C#, JavaScript, Swift, Pony, ML, Haskell.

# Types


Type expressions are used to specify the types of arguments, bound on type parameters,definitions of type constructors, and in type annotations.

```
<typ> ::=                                     type expressions
  <id> <typ-args>?                              constructor
  (shared|actor)? { <typ-field>;* }             object
  [ var? <typ> ]                                array
  Null                                          null type
  ? <typ>                                       option
  shared? <typ-params>? <typ> -> <typ>          function
  async <typ>                                   future
  ( ((<id> :)? <typ>),* )                       tuple
  Any                                           top
  None                                          bottom
  Shared                                        sharable types
  ( type )                                      parenthesized type
```

## Ground types

For `<id>` taking the form `Bool`, `Text`, `Char`, `Int`, `Nat` or `Word`*n*
(with *n* in 8, 16, 32, 64), the built-in ground types are
constituted. These come with a variety of built-in operations.

### The boolean type

`Bool` is inhabited by `true` and `false` and is typically eliminated
by an `if` expression.

Comparison TODO.

### The type of text

For representing prose, the built-in type `Text` is available. Its
operations include concatenation and iteration over its constituent
characters. The `textLength` function returns the number of characters
the text contains.

Comparison TODO.

### The type of characters

A `Char` represents a code point in the Unicode character
set. Characters can be converted to `Word32`, and `Word32`s in the
range *0 .. 0x1FFFFF* can be converted to `Char` (the conversion traps
if outside of this range). With `singletonText` a character can be
converted into a text of length 1.

Comparison TODO.

### Arithmetic types

The types `Int` and `Nat` are signed integral and natural numbers of
arbitrary precision with
the arithmetic operations of addition `(+)`, subtraction `(-)` (which
may trap for `Nat`), multiplication `(*)`, division `(/)`, modulus `(%)` and
exponentiation `(**)`. All arithmetic operations have type `t -> t ->
t` for `t` being `Int` or `Nat`. Additionally, since every inhabitant
of `Nat` is also an inhabitant of `Int`, the subtype relation `Nat <:
Int` holds.

Comparison TODO.

### Word types

The types `Word8`, `Word16`, `Word32` and `Word64` represent
fixed-width bit patterns of length *n* (8, 16, 32 and 64). Semanically word
types are also arithmetic types implementing numeric wrap-around
(modulo *2^n*).
Additionally bitwise operations are available, logical *and* `(&)`,
*or* `(|)` and *exclusive-or* `(^)`. Further, words can be rotated
left `(<<>)`, right `(<>>)`, and shifted left `(<<)`, right `(>>)`,
as well as right with two's-complement sign preserved (`shrs`).
All shift and rotate amounts are considered modulo the word's length
*n*.

Conversions to `Int` and `Nat`, named `word`*n*`ToInt` and
`word`*n*`ToNat`, are exact and expose the word's bit-pattern as
two's complement values, resp. natural numbers. Reverse conversions,
named `intToWord`*n* and `natToWord`*n* are potentially lossy, but the
round-trip property holds modulo *2^n*. The former choose the
two's-complement representation for negative integers.

Word types are not in subtype relationship with each other or with
other arithmetic types, and their literals need type annotation, e.g. 
`(-42 : Word16)`. For negative literals the two's-complement
representation is applied.

## Constructed types

 `<id> <typ-args>?` is the application of type a identifier, either built-in (i.e. Int) or user defined, to zero or more type *arguments*. 
 The type arguments must satisfy the bounds, if any, expected by the type constructor's type parameters (see below).

## Object types

`(shared|actor)? { <typ-field>;* }` specifies an object type by listing its zero or more named *type fields*. 

Within an object type, the names of fields must be distinct.

Object types that differ only in the ordering of the fields are equivalent.

The optional qualifier `shared` constrains the object's field to have *sharable* type. 

Messages (see below) always requires arguments of *sharable* (think *serializable*) type.

The optional qualifier `actor` constrains the object's fields to be *shared* functions (i.e. messages).


## Array types

`[ var? <typ> ]` specifies the type of arrays with elements of type `<typ>`. 

Arrays are immutable unless specified with qualifier `var`. 

## Null type

The `Null` type has a single value, the literal `null`. `Null` is a subtype of the option `? T`, for any type `T`. 

## Option types

`? <typ>` specifies the type of values that are either `null` or a proper value of the form `? <v>` where `<v>` has type `typ`.

## Function types

Type `shared? <typ-params>? <typ1> -> <typ2>` specifies the type of functions that consume (optional) type parameters `<typ-params>`, consume a value parameter of type `<typ1>` and produce a result of type `<typ2>`.

Both `<typ1>` and `<typ2>` may reference type parameters declared in `<typ-params>`.

If `<typ1>` or `<typ2>` (or both) is a tuple type, then the length of that tuple type determines the argument or result arity of the function type.

The optional `shared` qualifier specifies whether the function value is shared, which further constrains the form of `<typ-params>`, `<typ1>` and `<typ2>` (see *Sharability* below).

## Async types

`async <typ>` specifes a promise producing a value of a type `<typ>`. 

Promise types typically appear as the result type of a `shared` function that produces an `await`-able value.

## Tuple types

`( ((<id> :)? <typ>),* )` specifies the type of a tuple with zero or more ordered components.

The optional identifer `<id>`, naming its components, is for documentation purposes only and cannot be used for component access. In particular, tuple types that differ only in the names of fields are equivalent.

## Any type

Type `Any` is the *top* type, i.e. the super-type of all types, (think Object in Java or C#). All values have type any.

## None type

Type `None` is the *bottom* type, a subtype of all other types. 
No value has type `None`. 

As an empty type, `None` can be used to specify the (non-existant) return value of an infinite loop or trap.

## Shared type

Type `Shared`  is the super-type of all types that can be transmitted between actors (i.e. sent or received) as the arguments or return values of `shared` functions.


## Parenthesized type

A function that takes an immediate, syntactic tuple of length *n >= 0* as its domain or range is a function that takes (respectively returns) *n* values.

When enclosing the argument or result type of a function, which is itself a tuple type,  `( <tuple-typ> )` declares that the function takes or returns a single (boxed) value of type <tuple-type>.

In all other positions, `( <typ> )` has the same meaning as `<typ>`.

## Type fields

```
<typ-field> ::=                               object type fields
  <id> : <typ>                                  immutable
  var <id> : <typ>                              mutable
  <id> <typ-params>? <typ1> : <typ2>           function (short-hand)
```

A type field specifies the name and types of fields of an object.

`<id> : <typ>` specifies an *immutable* field, named `<id>` of type `<typ>`.

`var <id> : <typ>` specifies a *mutable* field, named `<id>` of type `<typ>`.

### Sugar

When enclosed by an `actor` object type, `<id> <typ-params>? <typ1> : <typ2>` is syntactic sugar for an immutable field name `<id>` of `shared` function type 
`shared <typ-params>? <typ1> -> <typ2>`.

When enlosed by a non-`actor` object type, `<id> <typ-params>? <typ1> : <typ2>` is syntactic sugar for an immutable field name `<id>` of ordinary function type `<typ-params>? <typ1> -> <typ2>`.


## Type parameters

```
<typ-params> ::=                              type parameters
  < typ-param,* >                         
<typ-param>
  <id> <: <typ>                               constrained type parameter
  <id>                                        unconstrained type parameter
```

A type constructors, function value or function type may be parameterised by a vector of comma-separated, optionally constrained, type parameters. 

`<id> <: <typ>` declares a type parameter with constraint `<typ>`. 
Any instantiation of `<id>` must subtype `<typ>` (at that same instantiation).

Syntactic sugar `<id>` declares a type parameter with implicit, trivial constraint `Any`.

The names of type parameters in a vector must be distinct. 

All type parameters declared in a vector are in scope within its bounds.

## Type arguments

```
<typ-args> ::=                                type arguments
  < <typ>,* >
```

Type constructors and functions may take type arguments. 

The number of type arguments must agree with the number of declared type parameters of the function.

Given a vector of type arguments instantiating a vector of type parameters, 
each type argument must satisfy the instantiated bounds of the corresponding 
type parameter.


## Wellformed types

A type `T` is well-formed only if (recursively) its constituent types are well-formed,and: 
* if `T` is `async U` then `U <: Shared`, and
* if `T` is `shared < ... > V -> W` then `...` is empty, `U <: Shared` and
  `W == ()` or `W == async W`, and
* if `T` is `C<T0, ..., TN>` where:
   * a declaration `type C<X0 <: U0, Xn <: Un>  = ...` is in scope, and
   * `Ti <: Ui[ T0/X0, ..., Tn/Xn ]`, for each `0 <= i <= n`. 
* if `T` is `actor { ... }` then all fields in `...` are immutable and have `shared` function type.
* if `T` is `shared { ... }` then all fields in `...` are immutable and have a type that subtypes `Shared`.

## Subtyping

Two types `T`, `U` are related by subtyping, written `T <: U`, whenever, one of the following conditions is true.

* `T` equals `U` (reflexivity).

* `U` equals `Any`. 

* `T` equals `None`.

*  `T` is a type parameter `X` declared with constraint `U`.

*  `T`is `Nat` and `U` is `Int`.

*  `T` is a tuple `(T0, ..., Tn)`, `U` is a tuple `(U0, ..., Un)`, 
    and for each `0 <= i <= n`, `Ti <: Ui`.

*  `T` is an immutable array type `[ V ]`, `U` is an immutable array type  `[ W ]` 
    and `V <: W`.

*  `T` is a mutable array type `[ var T ]`, `V` is a mutable array type  `[ var W ]` 
    and `V == W`.

*  `T` is `Null` and `U` is the an option type `? W`.

*  `T` is `? V`, `U` is `? W` and `V <: W`.

*  `T` is a promise `async V`, `U` is a promise `async W`, 
    and `V <: W`.

*  `T` is an object type `sort0 { fts0 }`, 
   `U` is an object type `sort1 { fts1 }` and
   * `sort1` == `sort2`, and, for all fields,
   * if field `id : V` is in `fts0` then `id : W` is in `fts1` and `V <: W`, and 
   * if mutable field `var id : V` is in `fts0` then  `var id : W` is in `fts1` and `V == W`.

   (That is, object type `T` is a subtype of object type `U` if they have same sort, every mutable field in `U` super-types the same field in `T` and every mutable field in `U` is mutable in `T` with an equivalent type. In particular, `T` may specify more fields than `U`.)

*  `T` is a function type `shared? <X0 <: V0, ..., Xn <: Vn> T1 -> T2`, 
   `U` is a function type `shared? <X0 <: W0, ..., Xn <: Wn> U1 -> U2` and
   * `T` and `U` are either both `shared` or both non-`shared`,
   *  for all `i`, `Vi <: Wi`,
   * `U1 <: T1` and
   * `T2 <: U2`.
  
    (That is, function type `T` is a subtype of function type `U` if they have same sort, they have the same type parameters, every bound in `U` super-types the same parameter bound in `T`, the domain of `U` suptypes the domain of `T` (contra-variance) and the range of `T` subtypes the range of `U`).

* `T` (respectively `U`) is a constructed type `C<V0,...VN>` that is equal, by definition of type constructor `C`,  to `W`, and `W <: U` (respectively `U <: W`).

* For some type `V`, `T <: V` and `V <: U` (*transitivity*).

* `U` is type `Shared` and `T` is equivalent to:
  * a `shared` function type, or
  * a `shared` object type, or
  * a `actor` object type, or
  * a scalar primitive type, or
  * the type `Text`, or
  * an immutable array type `[V]` with `V <: Shared`, or
  * the type `Null`, or
  * an option type `? V` with `V <: Shared`, or
  * a tuple type `(T0, ..., Tn)` where, for each `0 <= i <= n`, `Ti <: Shared`.

## Identifiers

The expression `<id>` evaluates to the value bound to `<id>` in the current evaluation environment.

## Literals

The literal (or constant) expression `<lit>` evaluates to itself.

## Unary operators
TBC (typing)

The unary operator expressions `<unop> <exp>` evaluates `exp` to a result. If the result is a value `v` it returns the result of `<unop> v`.
If the result is a trap, it, too traps.

## Binary operators
TBC (typing)

The binary operator expression `<exp1> <binop> <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `r1`  and `r2` are values `v1` and `v2` and the expression returns 
the result of `v1 <binop> v2`.

## Tuples 


Tuple expression `(<exp1>, ..., <expn>)` has tuple type `(T1, ..., Tn)`, provided
`<exp1>`, ..., `<expN>` have types `T1`, ..., `Tn`.

The tuple expression `(<exp1>, ..., <expn>)` evaluates the expressions `exp1` ... `expn` in order, trapping as soon as some expression <expi> traps. If no evaluation traps and `exp1`, ..., `<expn>` evaluate to values `v1`,...,`vn` then the tuple expression returns the tuple value `(v1, ... , vn)`.

The tuple projection `<exp> . <nat>` has type `Ti` provided <exp> has tuple type 
`(T1, ..., Ti, ..., Tn)`, `<nat>` == `i` and `1 <= i <= n`.

The projection `<exp> . <nat>` evaluates `exp` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, then  the result is `trap`. Otherwise, `r` must be a tuple  `(v1,...,vi,...,vn)` and the result of the projection is the value `vi`.

## Option expressions

The option expression `? <exp>` has type `? T` provided `<exp>` has type `T`.

The literal `null` has type `Null`. Since `Null <: ? T` for any `T`, literal `null` also has type `? T` and signifies the "missing" value at type `? T`.

## Object projection (Member access)


The object projection `<exp> . <id>` has type `var? T` provided <exp> has object type 
`sort { var1? <id1> : T1, ..., var? <id> : T, ..., var? <idn> : Tn }` for some sort `sort`. 

The object projection `<exp> . <id>` evaluates `exp` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`,then the result is `trap`. Otherwise, `r` must be an o 
bject value  ` { <id1> = v1,..., id = v, ..., <idn> = vn }` and the result of the projection is the value `v` of field `id`.


If `var` is absent from `var? T` then the value `v` is the constant value of immutable field `<id>`, otherwise:
* if the projection occurs as the target an assignment statement;
  `v` is the mutable location of the field `<id>`. 
* otherwise, 
  `v` (of type `T`) is the value currently stored in mutable field `<id>`.


## Assignment

The assigment `<exp1> := <exp2>` has type `()` provided:
* `<exp1>` has type `var T`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `T`.

The assignment expression `<exp1> := <exp2>` evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise `r1`  and `r2` are (respectively) a location `v1` (a mutable identifier, an item of a mutable array or a mutable field of object) and a value `v2`. The expression updates the current value stored in `v1` with the new value `v2` and returns the empty tuple `()`.

## Unary Compound Assignment

The unary compound assigment `<exp1> <unop>= <exp2>` has type `()` provided:
* `<exp1>` has type `var T`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `T`, and
* <unop> is one of `+` (identity), `-` (negation) or  `^` (xor),
* <unop> is defined for type `(T,T) -> T`.

For unary operator `<unop>` in `+` (identity), `-` (negation) or  `^` (xor), the unary compound assignment
`<unop>= <exp>`  evaluates <exp> to a result `r`. If `r` is 'trap' the evaluation traps, otherwise `r` is a location storing value `v` and `r` is updated to 
contain the value `<unop> v`.

## Binary Compound Assignment

The binary compound assigment `<exp1> <binop>= <exp2>` has type `()` provided:
* `<exp1>` has type `var T`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `T`, and
* <binop> is defined for type `(T,T) -> T`.

For binary operator <binop>, `<exp1> <binop>= <exp1>`,
the compound assignment expression `<exp1> <binop>= <exp2>` evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.
Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise `r1`  and `r2` are (respectively) a location `v1` (a mutable identifier, an item of a mutable array or a mutable field of object) and a value `v2`. The expression updates the current value, `w` stored in `v1` with the new value `w <binop> v2` and returns the empty tuple `()`.

## Arrays 

The expression `[ var? <exp>,* ]` has type `[var? T]` provided
each expression `<exp>` in the sequence `<exp,>*` has type T.

 The array expression `[ var <exp0>, ..., <expn> ]` evaluates the expressions false`exp0` ... `expn` in order, trapping as soon as some expression `<expi>` traps. If no evaluation traps and `exp0`, ..., `<expn>` evaluate to values `v0`,...,`vn` then the array expression returns the array value `[var? v0, ... , vn]` (of size `n+1`).

The array indexing expression `<exp1> [ <exp2> ]` has type `var? T` provided <exp> has (mutable or immutable) array type `[var? T1]`.

The projection `<exp1> . <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, then the result is `trap`. 

Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `r1` is an array value, `var? [v0, ..., vn]`, and r2 is a natural integer `i`. If  'i > n' the index expression returns `trap`.

Otherwise, the index expression returns the value `v`, obtained as follows:

If `var` is absent from `var? T` then the value `v` is the constant value `vi`.

Otherwise,
* if the projection occurs as the target an assignment statement
  then `v` is the `i`-th location in the array;
* otherwise, 
  `v` is `vi`, the value currently stored in the `i`-th location of the array.

## Function Calls

The function call expression `<exp1> <T0,...,Tn>? <exp2>` has type `T` provided
* the function `<exp1>` has function type `shared? < X0 <: V0, ..., Xn <: Vn > U1-> U2`; and
* each type argument satisfies the corresponding type parameter's bounds:
  for each `1<= i <= n`, `Ti <: [T0/X0, ..., Tn/Xn]Vi`; and
* the argument `<exp2>` has type `[T0/X0, ..., Tn/Xn]U1`, and
* `T == [T0/X0, ..., Tn/Xn]U2`.

The call expression `<exp1> <T0,...,Tn>? <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, then the result is `trap`. 

Otherwise, `exp2` is evaluated to a result `r2`. If `r2` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`.

Otherwise, `r1` is a function value, `shared? func <X0 <: V0, ..., n <: Vn> pat { exp }` (for some implicit environment), and `r2` is a value `v2`. Evaluation continues by matching `v1` against `pat`. If matching succeeds with some bindings, evaluation proceeds with `exp` using the environment of the function value (not shown) extended with those bindings. Otherwise, the pattern match has failed and the call results in `trap`.

## Functions

The function expression `shared? func < X0 <: T1, ..., Xn <: Tn > <pat> (: T2)? =?  <exp>` has type `shared? < X0 <: T0, ..., Xn <: Tn > T1-> T2` if, under the 
assumption that `X0 <: T1, ..., Xn <: Tn`:
* all the types in `T1, ..., Tn` and `T` are well-formed and well-constrained. 
* pattern `pat` has type `T1`;
* expression `<exp>` has type return type `T2` under the assumption that `pat` has type `T1`.

`shared? func <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <exp>` evaluates to a function
value (a.k.a. closure), denoted `shared? func <typ-params>? <pat> = <exp>`, that stores the code of the function together with the bindings from the current evaluation environment (not shown) needed to evaluate calls to the function value.

## Blocks

The block expression `{ <dec>;* }` has type `T` provided the last declaration in the sequence `<dec>;*` has type `T`.
All identifiers declared in block must be distinct type identifiers or distinct value identifiers and are in scope in the definition of all other declarations in the block.

The bindings of identifiers declared in { dec;* } are local to the block. 
The type `T` must be well-formed in the enclosing environment of the block. In particular, any local, recursive types that cannot be expanded to types well-formed the enclosing environment must not appear in `T`.

The type system ensures that a value identifer cannot be evaluated before its declaration has been evaluated, precluding run-time errors at the cost of rejection some well-behaved programs.

Identifiers whose types cannot be inferred from their declaration, but are used in a forward reference, may require an additional type annotation (see Annotated patterns) to satisfy the type checker.

The block expression `{ <dec>;* }` evaluates each declaration in `<dec>;*` in sequence (program order). The first declaration in `<dec>;*` that results in a trap cause the block to result in `trap`, without evaluating subsequent declarations.

## Not

The not expression 'not <exp>' has type `Bool` provided `<exp>` has type `Bool`.

If `<exp>` evaluates to `trap`, the expression returns `trap`.
Otherwise, `<exp>` evaluates to a boolean value `v` and the expression returns `not v`, (the boolean negation of `v`).

## And

The and expression `<exp1> and <exp2>` has type `Bool` provided `<exp1>` and `<exp2>` have type `Bool`.

The expression `<exp1> and <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`. Otherwise `r1` is a boolean value `v`. 
If `v == false` the expression returns the value `false` (without evaluating `<exp2>`).
Otherwise, the expression returns the result of evaluating <exp2>.

## Or

The or expression `<exp1> or <exp2>` has type `Bool` provided `<exp1>` and `<exp2>` have type `Bool`.

The expression `<exp1> and <exp2>` evaluates `exp1` to a result `r1`. If `r1` is `trap`, the expression results in `trap`. Otherwise `r1` is a boolean value `v`. 
If `v == true` the expression returns the value `true` (without evaluating `<exp2>`).
Otherwise, the expression returns the result of evaluating <exp2>.

## If 

The expression `if <exp1> <exp2> (else <exp3>)?` has type `T` provided:
* `<exp1>` has type `Bool`
* `<exp2>` has type `T`
* `<exp3>` is absent and `() <: T`, or
* `<exp3>` is present and has type `T`.

The expression evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r1`. 
If `r1` is `trap`, the result is  `trap`. 
Otherwise, `r1` is the value `true` or `false`. 
If `r1` is `true`, the result is the result of evaluating `<exp2>`. 
Otherwise, `r1` is `false` and the result is `()` (if <exp3> is absent) or the result of `<exp3>` (if <exp3> is present).

## Switch

The switch exression 
  `switch <exp0> { (case <pat> <exp>)+ }`  
has type `T` provided:
* `exp0` has type `U`; and
* for each case `case <pat> <exp>` in the sequence `(case <pat> <exp>)+` :
  * pattern `<pat>` has type `U`; and, 
  * expression `<exp>` has type `T` 
    (in an environment extended with `<pat>`'s bindings).

The expression evaluates `<exp0>` to a result `r1`. 
If `r1` is `trap`, the result is `trap`. 
Otherwise, `r1` is some value `v`. 
Let `case <pat> <exp>` be the first case in `(case <pat> <exp>)+` such that `<pat>` matches `v` with for some bindings of identifiers to values.
Then result of the `switch` is the result of evaluating `<exp>` unders those bindings.
If no case has a pattern that matches `v`, the result of the switch is `trap`.

## While

The expression `while <exp1> <exp2>` has type `()` provided:
* `<exp1>` has type `Bool`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `()`.

The expression evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r1`. 
If `r1` is `trap`, the result is `trap`. 
Otherwise, `r1` is the value `true` or `false`. 
If `r1` is `true`, the result is the result of re-evaluating `while <exp1> <exp2>`. 
Otherwise, the result is `()`.

## Loop

The expression `loop <exp>` has type `None` provided `<exp>` has type `()`.

The expression evaluates `<exp>` to a result `r1`. 
If `r1` is `trap`, the result is `trap`. 
Otherwise, the result is the result of (re-)evaluating `loop <exp1>`. 

## Loop While

The expression `loop <exp1> while <exp2>` has type `()` provided:
* `<exp1>` has type `()`, and
* `<exp2>` has type `Bool`.

The expression evaluates `<exp1>` to a result `r1`. 
If `r1` is `trap`, the result is `trap`. 
Otherwise, evaluation continues with `<exp2>`, producing result `r2`.
If `r2` is `trap` the result is `trap`.
Otherwise, if `r2` is `true`, the result is the result of re-evaluating `loop <exp1> while <exp2>`. 
Otherwise, `r2` is false and the result is `()`.

## For

The for expression `for ( <pat> in <exp1> ) <exp2>` has type `()` provided:
* `<exp1>` has type `(object|shared) { Next : () -> ?T; }`;
* pattern `<pat>` has type `U`; and, 
* expression `<exp2>` has type `()` (in the environment extended with `<pat>`'s bindings).

The `for`-expression is syntactic sugar for

```
for ( <pat> in <exp1> ) <exp2> :=
  { 
    let x = exp1;
    label l
    loop {
      switch (x.Next()) {
        case (? pat) exp2;
        case (null) break l;
      };
    };
  };
```
where `x` is fresh identifier.

In particular, the `for` loops will trap if evaluation of `<exp1>` traps; as soon as some value of `x.Next()` traps or the value of `x.Next()` does not match pattern `<pat>`.


_TBR: do we want this semantics? We could, instead, skip values that don't match `<pat>`?_

## Label

The label-expression  `label <id> (: <typ>)? <exp>` has type `T` provided:
* (: <typ>)? is absent and `T` is unit; or (: <typ>)? is present and `T == <typ>`;
* <exp> has type `T` in the static environment extended with `label l : T`.

The result of evaluating `label <id> (: <typ>)? <exp>` is the result of evaluating `<exp>`.

### Labeled loops

If <exp> is a looping construct, `while (exp2) <exp1>`, `loop <exp1> (while (<exp2>))?` of `for (<pat> in <exp2> <exp1>` 
the body, <exp1>, of the loop is implicitly enclosed in `label <id_continue> (...)` allowing early continuation of loop by the evaluation of expression `continue <id>`.

<id_continue> is fresh identifer that can only be referenced by `continue <id>`.

## Break

The expression `break <id>` is equivalent to `break <id> ()`.

The expression `break <id> <exp>` has type `Any` provided:
* The label <id> is declared with type `label l : T`.
* `<exp>` has type `T`.

The evaluation of `break <id> <exp>` evaluates exp to some result `r`. 
If `r` is `trap`, the result is `trap`.
If `r` is a value `v`, the evaluation abandons the current computation up to dynamically enclosing declaration `label <id> ...` using the value `v` as the result of that labelled expression.

## Continue

The expression `continue <id>` is equivalent to `break <id_continue>`, where
 <id_continue> is implicitly declared around the bodies of <id>-labelled looping constructs (See Section Labeled Loops).


## Return

`return`; is equivalent to `return ();`

The expression `return <exp>` has type `None` provided:
* `<exp>` has type `T` and
  * `T` is the return type of the nearest enclosing function (with no intervening `async` expression), or
  * `async T` is the type of the nearest enclosing (perhaps implicit) `async` expression (with no intervening function declaration)

The `return` expression exits the corresponding dynamic function invocation or completes the corresponding dynamic async expression with the result of `exp`.

TBR async traps?

### Async

The async expression `async <exp>` has type `async T` provided:
* `<exp>` has type `T`;
* `T <: Shared`.

Any control-flow label in scope for `async <exp>` is not in scope for `<exp>` (that `<exp>` may declare its own, local, labels.

The implicit return type in `<exp>` is `T`. That is, the return argument, `<exp0>`, (implicit or explicit) to any enclosed `return <exp0>?` expression, must have type `T`.

Evaluation of `async <exp>` queues a message to evaluate `<exp>` in the nearest enclosing or top-level actor. It immediately returns a promise of type `async T` that can be used to `await` the result of the pending evaluation of `<exp>`.

### Await

The `await` expression `await <exp>` has type `T` provided:
* <exp> has type `async T`,
* `T <: Shared`.
* the `await` is explicitly enclosed by an `async`-expression or its nearest enclosing function is `shared`.

`await <exp>` evaluates `<exp>` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, evaluation returns `trap`. Otherwise `r1` is a promise. If the promise is complete with value `v`, then `await <exp>` evaluates to value `v`. If the `promise` is incomplete, that is, its evaluation is still pending, `await <exp>` suspends evaluation of the neared enclosing `async` or `shared`-function, adding the suspension to the wait-queue of the `promise`. Execution of the suspension is resumed once the promise is completed (if ever).

_WARNING:_ between suspension and resumption of a computation, the state of the enclosing actor may change due to concurrent processing of other incoming actor messages. It the programmer responsibility's to guard against non-synchronized state changes.

### Assert

The assert expression "assert <exp>" has type `()` provided `exp` has type `Bool`.

`assert <exp>` evaluates `<exp>` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap` evaluation returns `trap`. Otherwise `r` is a boolean value `v`. The result of `assert <exp>` is
* the value `()`, when `v` is `true`; or
* `trap`, when `v` is `false`.

### Type Annotation

The type annotation expression `<exp> : <typ>` has type `T` provided:
* `<typ>` is `T`, and 
* `<exp>` has type `T`.

Type annotation may be used to aid the type-checker when it cannot otherwise determine the type of `<exp>` or when one want to constraint the inferred type, `U` of `<exp>` to a less-informative super-type `T` provided `U <: T`.

The result of evaluating `<exp> : <typ>` is the result of evaluating `<exp>`. 

Note: type annotations have no-runtime cost and cannot be used to perform the (checked or unchecked) `down-casts` available in other object-oriented languages.

### Declaration Expression

The declaration expression `<dec>` has type `T` provided the declaration `<dec>` has type `T`.

Evaluating the expression `<dec>` proceed by evaluating `<dec>`, returning the result of `<dec>` but discarding the bindings introduced by `<dec>` (if any).

### Parentheses

The parenthesized expression `( <exp> )` has type `T` provided `<exp>` has type `T`.

The result of evaluating `( <exp> : <typ> )` is the result of evaluating `<exp>`. 

Note: type annotations have no-runtime cost and are only used to group expression and/or override precedence of language constructs.

# Patterns

```
<pat> ::=                                      patterns
  _                                              wildcard
  <id>                                           variable
  <unop>? <lit>                                  literal
  ( <pat>,* )                                    tuple or brackets
  ? <pat>                                        option
  <pat> : <typ>                                  type annotation
  <pat> or <pat>                                 disjunctive pattern
```
*Patterns* `pat` are used to bind function parameters, declare identifiers and decompose values into their constituent parts in the cases of a `switch` expression.

Matching a pattern against a value may *succeed*, binding the corresponding identifiers in the pattern to their matching values, or *fail*. Thus the result of a match is either a a successful mapping of identifiers to values, or failure.

The consequences of pattern match failure depends on the context of the pattern. 
* In a function application or `let`-binding, failure to match the formal argument pattern or `let`-pattern causes a *trap*.
* In a `case` branch of a `switch` expression, failure to match that case's pattern continues with an attempt to match the next case of the switch, trapping only when no such case remains.

## Wildcard pattern

The wildcard pattern `_`  matches a single value without binding its contents to an identifier. 


## Identifier pattern

The identifier pattern `<id>` matches a single value and binds it to the identifier `<id>`.

## Literal pattern

The literal pattern `<unop>? <lit>` matches a single value against the constant value of literal `<lit>` and fails if they are not (structurally) equal values. 

For integer literals only, the optional `<unop>` determines the sign of the value to match.

## Annotated pattern

The annotated pattern `<pat> : <typ>` matches value of `v` type `<typ>` against the pattern `<pat>`.

`<pat> : <typ>` is *not* a dynamic type test, but is used to constrain the types of identifiers bound in `<pat>`, e.g. in the argument pattern to a function.


## Option pattern

The option `? <pat>` matches a value of option type `? <typ>`. 

The match *fails* if the value is `null`. If the value is `? v`, for some value `v`, then the result of matching `? <pat>` is the result of matching `v` against <pat>.

Conversely, the `null` literal pattern may be used to test whether a value of option type is the value `null` and not `? v` for some `v`.

## Or pattern

The or pattern `<pat1> or <pat2>` is a disjunctive pattern. 

The result of matching `<pat1> or <pat2>` against a value is the result of
matching `<pat1>`, if it succeeds, or the result of matching `<pat2>`, if the first match fails. 

(Note, statically, neither `<pat1>` nor `<pat2>` may contain identifier (`<id>`) patterns so a successful match always binds zero identifiers.)

# Declarations

```
<dec> ::=                                                       declaration

```
## Expression Declaration

The declaration `<exp>` has type `T` provided the expression `<exp>` has type `T` . It declares no bindings.`Ubuntu Mono`

The declaration `<exp>` evaluates to the result of evaluating `<exp>` (typically for `<exp>`'s side-effect).

TBR

## Let Declaration

The let declaration `<pat> = <exp>` has type `T` and declares the bindings in `<pat>` provided:
* `<exp>` has type `T`.
* `<pat>` has type `T`.

The `<pat> = <exp>` evaluates `<exp>` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, the declaration evaluates to `trap`. If `r` is a value `v` then evaluation proceeds by
matching the value `v` against `<pat>`. If matching fails, then the result is `trap`. Otherwise, the result is `v` and the binding of all identifiers in `<pat>` to their matching values in `v`.

All bindings declared by a let (if any) are *immutable*.

## Var Declaration

The variable declaration `var <id> (: <typ>)? = <exp>` declares a *mutable* variable `<id>` with initial value `<exp>`. The variable's value can be updated by assignment.

The declaration `var <id>` has type `()` provided:
* `<exp>` has type `T`; and 
* If the annotation `(:<typ>)?` is present, then `T == <typ>`.

Within the scope of the declaration, <id> has type `var T` (see Assignment).

Evaluation of `var <id> (: <typ>)? = <exp>` proceeds by evaluating `<exp>` to a result `r`. If `r` is `trap`, the declaration evaluates to `trap`. Otherwise, the
`r` is some value `v` that determines the initial value of mutable variable `<id>`.
The result of the declaration is `()` and
`<id>` is bound to a fresh location that contains `v`.

## Type Declaration

The declaration `type <id> <typ-params>? = <typ>` declares a new type constructor `<id>`, with optional type parameters `<typ-params>` and definition `<typ>`.

The declaration `type C < X0<:T0>, ..., Xn <: Tn > = U` is well-formed provided:
* type parameters `X0`, ..., `Xn` are distinct, and
* assuming the constraints `X0 <: T0`, ..., `Xn <: Tn`:
    * constraints `T0`, ..., `Tn` are well-formed.
    * definition `U` is well-formed.

In scope of the declaration  `type C < X0<:T0>, ..., Xn <: Tn > = U`, any  well-formed type `C < U0, ..., Un>` is equivalent to its expansion 
`U [ U0/X0, ..., Un/Xn ]`.  Distinct type expressions that expand to identical types are inter-changeable, regardless of any distinction between type constructor names. In short, the equivalence between types is structural, not nominal.  

## Object Declaration

Declaration `(new|object|actor|shared) <id>? =? { <exp-field>;* }` declares an object with optional identifier `<id>` and zero or more fields `<exp_field>;*`.

The qualifier `new|object|actor|shared` specifies the *sort* of the object's type (`new` is equivalent to `object`). The sort imposes restrictions on the types of the non-private object fields and the sharability of the object itself.

Let `T = sort { [var0] id0 : T0, ... , [varn] idn : T0 }` denote the type of the object. 
Let `<dec>;*` be the sequence of declarations in `<exp_field>;*`.
The object declaration has type `T` provided that:
1. type `T` is well-formed for sort `sort`, and
2. under the assumption that `<id> : T`, 
   * the sequence of declarations `<dec>;*` has type `Any` and declares the disjoint sets of private and non-private identifers, `Id_private` and `Id_public` respectively,
     with types `T(id)` for `id` in `Id == Id_private union Id_public`.
   * `{ id0, ..., idn } == Id_public` 
   *  for all `i in 0 <= i <= n`, `[vari] Ti == T(idi)`.

Note that requirement 1. imposes further constraints on the fields type of `T`.
In particular:
* if the sort is `actor` then all non-private fields must be non-`var` (immutable) `shared` functions (the public interface of an actor can only provide asynchronous messaging via shared functions).
* if the sort is `shared` then all non-private field must be non-`var` (immutable) and of a type that is sharable (`T(idi) <: Shared`). Shared objects can be sent as arguments to `shared` functions or returned as the result of a `shared` function (wrapped in a promise).

Evaluation of `(new|object|actor|shared) <id>? =? { <exp-field>;* }` proceeds by
evaluating the declarations in `<dec>;*`. If the evaluation of `<dec>;*` traps, so does the object declaration. 
Otherwise, `<dec>;*` produces a set of bindings for identifiers in `Id`. 
let `v0`, ..., `vn` be the values or locations bound to identifiers `<id0>`, ..., `<idn>`. 
The result of the object declaration is the object `v == sort { <id0> = v1, ..., <idn> = vn}`.

If `<id>?` is present, the declaration binds `<id>` to `v`. Otherwise, it produces the empty set of bindings. 

_TBR do we actually propagate trapping of actor creation?_

## Function Declaration

The function declaration  `shared? func <id>? <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <exp>` is syntactic sugar for
a `let` declaration of a function expression. That is:

```
<func_exp> ::= <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <exp>
shared? func <id> <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <exp> :=
  let <id> = shared? func <id> <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <exp>
```

where `<pat>` is `<id>` when `<id>?` is present and `<pat>` is `_` otherwise.

Named function definitions are recursive.

## Class declarations

The declaration `obj_sort? class <id> <typ-params>? <pat> =? <id_this>? { <exp-field>;* }` is sugar for pair of a 
a type and function declaration:

```
obj_sort? class <id> <typ-params>? <pat> (: <typ>)? =? <id_this>? { <exp-field>;* } :=
  type <id> <typ-params> = sort { <typ-field>;* };
  func <id> <typ-params>? <pat> : <id> <typ-args>  = sort <id_this>? { <exp-field>;* }
```

where:
* `<sort>` is `object` if `obj_sort?` is absent or `new` and `sort == obj_sort` otherwise.
* `<typ-args>?` is the sequence of type identifiers bound by `<typ-params>?` (if any), and 
* `<typ-field>;*` is the set of non-`private` field types inferred from `<exp_field;*>`.
* `<id_this>?` is the optional `this` parameter of the object instance.

_TBR can we delete `new'?_

## Expression Fields

```

Expression fields declare the fields of actors and objects. 

The expression field `private? dec` is just a declaration, prefixed by an optional visibility qualifier 'private?'.

Any identifier bound by a non-`private` declaration appears in the type of enclosing object and is accessible via the dot notation.

An identifier bound by a `private` declaration is excluded form the type of the enclosing object and inaccessible via the dot notation.

The declaration `private? <id> = <exp>` is syntactic sugar for a let declaration:

```
private? <id> = <exp> =
  private let <id> = <exp>
```

The field expression `private? <id> = <exp>` is syntactic sugar for a let declaration:

```
private? <id> = <exp> ::=
  private? let <id> = <exp>
```

The field expression `private? shared? <id>? <func_exp>` is syntactic sugar for a function declaration:

```
  private? private? shared? <id>? <func_exp> ::=
  private? let <id> = shared? <func_exp>
```
# Sequence of Declarations

A sequence of declarations `<dec>;*` occurring in a block, a program or the `exp-field;*` sequence of an object declaration has type `T` 
provided
* `<dec>;*` is empty and `T == ()`; or
* `<dec>;*` is non-empty and:
    * all value identifiers bound by `<dec>;*` are distinct, and
    * all type identifiers bound by `<dec>;*` are distinct, and
    * under the assumption that each value identifier `<id>` in `decs;*` has type `var_id? Tid`,  
      and the type definitions in `decs;*`.
      * each declaration in `<dec>;*` is well-typed;
      * each value identifier `<id>` in bindings produced by `<dec>;*` has type `var_id? Tid`.  
      * the last declaration in `<dec>;*` has type `T`.

Declarations in `<dec>;*` are evaluated sequentially. The first declaration that traps cause the entire sequence to trap.
Otherwise, the result of the declaration is the value of the last declaration in `<dec>;*`; the set of value bindings defined by decs is 
the union of the bindings introduced by each declaration in `<dec>;*`.

It is a compile-time error if any declaration in `<dec>;*`, might require the value of an identifier declared in `<dec>;*` 
before that identifier's definition has been evaluated. Such *use-before-define* errors are detected by a simple, conservative static analysis 
not described here.

# Programs

```
<prog> ::= <dec>;*

```

A program `<prog>` is sequence of declarations `<dec>;*` that ends with an optional actor declaration that determines the main actor, if any, of the program.

All type and value declarations within `<prog>` are mutually-recursive.
