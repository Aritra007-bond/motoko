 Sets
 ========

 Sets are partial maps from element type to unit type,
 i.e., the partial map represents the set with its domain.

 TODO-Matthew:
 ---------------

 - for now, we pass a hash value each time we pass an element value;
   in the future, we might avoid passing element hashes with each element in the API;
   related to: https://dfinity.atlassian.net/browse/AST-32

 - similarly, we pass an equality function when we do some operations.
   in the future, we might avoid this via https://dfinity.atlassian.net/browse/AST-32
