Server Model
===============================

Here, we depart from defining PESS, and turn our attention to the
internal representation of the server actor's state.  The behavior of
this actor is part of the PESS definition, but the internal data model
representations it uses are not.

We have the freedom to model the system to best match the kinds of
updates and queries that we must handle now, and anticipate handling
in the future.

We employ a purely-functional repesentation based on tree-shaped data
structures with sharing.  See `ServerModelTypes.as` for details.
Below, we explain our representation of traditional SQL tables in
terms of nested structures and finite maps.

   Generate Symbols
   -----------------
   We implement "gensym" functionality with a collection of counters, one per kind of named entity:

```
...
```


   Mostly-static collections:
   ---------------------------
   We use the following variables to represent the following tables from the design documents:

   - regions table
   - produce table
   - truck type table

```
...
```
Producers collection:
----------------------
We use the following variable to represents the following tables, as a tree-shaped functional data structure, with sharing:
 - producer table
 - inventory table (shared with variable inventory)
 - reservedInventory table (formerly "orderedInventory" table) (xxx shared with variable reservations)
```
...
```
Transporters collection:
----------------------
Represents the following tables, as a tree-shaped functional data structure, with sharing:
 - transporter table
 - route table (shared with variable routes)
 - reservedRoute table (formerly "orderedRoutes" table) (xxx shared with variable reservations)
```
...
```
Retailers collection:
----------------------
Represents the following tables, as a tree-shaped functional data structure, with sharing:
 - retailer table
 - reservation table (formerly "orders" table)
```
...
```

   Indexing for queries
   ====================

   For efficient queries, need some extra indexing.

   Regions as keys in special global maps
   ---------------------------------------
   - inventory (across all producers) keyed by producer region
   - routes (across all transporters) keyed by source region
   - routes (across all transporters) keyed by destination region

   Indexing by time
   -----------------
   For now, we won't try to index based on days.

   If and when we want to do so, we would like to have a spatial
   data structure that knows about each object's "interval" in a
   single shared dimension (in time):

   - inventory, by availability window (start day, end day)
   - routes, by transport window (departure day, arrival day)

   Routes by region-region pair
   ----------------------------

   the actor maintains a possibly-sparse 3D table mapping each
   region-region-routeid triple to zero or one routes.  First index
   is destination region, second index is source region; this 2D
   spatial coordinate gives all routes that go to that destination
   from that source, keyed by their unique route ID, the third
   coordinate of the mapping.

```
...
```
Inventory by source region
----------------------------
the actor maintains a possibly-sparse 3D table mapping each
sourceregion-producerid-inventoryid triple to zero or one
inventory items.  The 1D coordinate sourceregion gives all of the
inventory items, by producer id, for this source region.

   reigstrarAddTruckType
   -------------------

```

```

   registrarRemTruckTypes
   ---------------------

   returns `?()` on success, and `null` on failure.

```
...
```
registrarAddRegion
---------------------
adds the region to the system; fails if the given information is
invalid in any way.
```

```
registrarRemProduce
---------------------
returns `?()` on success, and `null` on failure.
```
...
```
registrarAddProduce
---------------------
adds the produce to the system; fails if the given information is invalid in any way.
```
...
```
registrarRemProduce
---------------------
returns `?()` on success, and `null` on failure.
```
...
```
registrarAddProducer
---------------------
adds the producer to the system; fails if the given region is non-existent.
```
...
```
registrarRemProducer
---------------------
returns `?()` on success, and `null` on failure.
```
...
```
registrarAddRetailer
---------------------
adds the producer to the system; fails if the given region is non-existent.
```

retailerReserve
---------------------------

retailerReserveCheapest
---------------------------
Like `retailerReserve`, but chooses cheapest choice among all
feasible produce inventory items and routes, given a grade,
quant, and delivery window.
?? This may be an example of what Mack described to me as
wanting, and being important -- a "conditional update"?
