 Server Types
 ==================

 This file defines structures that appear the server actor's messaging
 interface.  They are part of the formal PESS definition.

PESS: Basic types for PESS
-----------------------------
These types standardize representations for many common PESS notions
```

```
PESS: Unique Ids
-----------------
Externally, these Ids give a unique identifier that is unique to its type, but not universally unique.
Internally, each type of Id serves as a "row key" for a table (or two).
```
...
```
PESS: Query parameters and results
----------------------------------
Externally, these types define the input and output structures for PESS queries.
Internally, producing instances of the result structures will require
performing joins based on internal tables, and the information from the input structures.
Note: We are using "reserve", "reserved" and "reservation" in place of "order"
below, since "order" and "ordering" have too many meanings in a
broader CS/programming/query context.
```

```


xxx how to represent huge result messages?

2019.03.12 *** TODO-Cursors: Introduce the idea of "cursors", with
allocation, de-allocation and movement messages, as per discussion in
the 2019.03.12 ActorScript Team meeting.
