Critical modules
==================
 - [x] **List**: See [`List` module from SML Basis library](http://sml-family.org/Basis/list.html).
 - [x] **Hashtrie**: Persistent maps, as functional hash tries.
 - [x] **Set**: Persistent sets, based directly on persistent maps.
 - [ ] **Hashtable**: Mutable maps, as imperative hash tables.

Secondary modules
==================
These modules _may_ be useful in the collections library:
 - [ ] **Stream**: Type def done; most operations are pending...

Other modules
==================
These modules are merely exercises (toys/examples), and _not_ essential to the collections library:
 - [ ] **Thunk**: Type def and some operations are done.
