## Installation using Nix

To install the `asc` binary into your nix environment, use

```
$ nix-env -i -f . -A asc
```

## Development using Nix

This is the command that should always pass on master is the following, which builds everything:
```
$ nix-build
```

To enter a shell with the necessary dependencies, you can use
```
$ nix-shell
```
within this shell you can run
 * `make` in `src/` to build all binaries,
 * `make asc` in `src/` to build just the `asc` binary,
 * `make DUNE_OPTS=--watch asc` to keep rebuilding as source files are changing
 * `make` in `rts/` to build the ActorScript runtime
 * `make` in `test/` to run the test suite.

This invokes `dune` under the hood, which will, as a side effect, also create
`.merlin` files for Merlin integration.

## Development without Nix

You can get a development environment that is independent of nix (although
installing all required tools without nix is out of scope).

 * Use your systemâ€™s package manager to install `ocaml` and
   [`opam`](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
 * Install the packages:
   ```
   opam install num vlq yojson menhir
   ```
 * Install the `wasm` Ocaml package. We use a newer version than is on opam, and a
   fork that supports the multi-value extension. See `nix/ocaml-wasm.nix` for
   the precise repository and version. You can use `nix` to fetch the correct
   source for you, and run the manual installation inside:
   ```
   cd $(nix-build -Q -A wasm.src)/interpreter
   make install
   ```
 * Install various command line tools used by, in particuar, the test suite:
   ```
   nix-env -i -f . -A wasm
   nix-env -i -f . -A filecheck
   nix-env -i -f . -A wabt
   nix-env -i -f . -A dvm
   ```
 * Building the ActorScript runtime without nix is tricky. But you can run
   ```
   nix-shell --run 'make -C rts'
   ```
   to get `rts/as-rts.wasm`.


## Create a coverage report

The coverage report support got dropped when switching to `dune`. Please monitor
https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/57 to see when a coverage report is viable again.

## Profile the compiler

1. Build with profiling (TODO: How to do with dune)
   ```
   make -C src clean
   make BUILD=p.native -C src asc
   ```
2. Run `asc` as normal, e.g.
   ```
   ./src/asc -c foo.as -o foo.wasm
   ```
   this should dump a `gmon.out` file in the current directory.
3. Create the report, e.g. using
   ```
   gprof --graph src/asc
   ```
   (Note that you have to _run_ this in the directory with `gmon.out`, but
   _pass_ it the path to the binary.)
