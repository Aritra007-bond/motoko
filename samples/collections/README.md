[ ] **Hashtrie**: Persistent maps, as functional hash tries.
[ ] **Hashtable**: Mutable maps, as imperative hash tables.

Secondary modules

Other modules
==================
These modules are merely exercises (toys/examples), and _not_ essential to the collections library:
[ ] **Thunk**: Type def and some operations are done; XXX: see `pair` function for a strange type error.
