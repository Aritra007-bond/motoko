= Principals and caller identification
:proglang: Motoko
:IC: Internet Computer


{proglang}'s shared functions support a simple form of caller identification.
This allow you to inspect the {IC} _principal_ (or identity) of the caller of a function.
The principal of a call corresponds to either a user or a canister.

You can use this feature to implement basic _access-control_.

In {proglang}, the `shared` keyword, used to declare a shared function, can declare an optional parameter of type `{caller : Principal}`. (The type is a record to accommodate future extension.)

To access the caller of a shared function like `inc()` you write:

....
shared(msg) func inc() : async () {
  ... msg.caller ...
}
....

Here, `msg` names the parameter, a record, and `msg.caller` accesses the principal field of `msg`.

The call sites of `inc()` do not change - the caller's principal is provided the system, not the user, so it cannot be forged or spoofed by a malicious user.

To access the caller of an actor class constructor, you use the same (optional) syntax on the actor class declaration:

....
shared(msg) actor class Counter(init : Nat) {
  ... msg.caller ...
}
....

For example, suppose we want to restrict our `Counter` actor so it can only be modified by the installer of the `Counter`.

To do so, you can record the principal that installed the actor, call it  `owner`,
and check that the caller of each method is equal to `owner`:

----
include::../examples/Counters-caller.mo[]
----


The `assert (owner == msg.caller)` causes functions `inc()` and `bump()` to trap if the call is unauthorized, preventing any modification of `count`; `read()` permits any caller.

Principals support equality, ordering and hashing, so you can efficiently store principals in containers to, for example, maintain an allow or deny list.
More operations on principals are available in base library link:../base-libraries/result{outfilesuffix}[Principal].

The argument to `shared` is just a pattern, so, if you prefer, you can also rewrite the above to use pattern matching:

include::../examples/Counters-caller-pat.mo[]

NOTE: Simple actor declarations do not let you access their installer.
If you do need access to the installer of an actor,
just rewrite the actor declaration as a zero-argument actor class instead.
