= Actors and async data
:proglang: Motoko
:company-id: DFINITY

{proglang} provides an *actor-based* programming model to developers to express _server behavior_, including that of _micro services_ on the Internet and the Internet Computer.

An actor is similar to an object, but is special in that its isolated state exists _remotely_, and its interactions with the world are _asynchronous_.

Each {proglang} actor represents a service that one might want to deploy on the Internet Computer.

The interface of each actor introduces `async` data whenever it returns information to its caller.
This programming abstraction serves a key role in {proglang}, as it coordinates with the transformations of the {proglang} compiler pipeline and eventual execution behavior of {proglang} actors on the Internet Computer.

This abstraction represents a _promise_ from the system to the caller, on behalf of the callee:

 - Either the `async` value, when ``await``ed, will yield a value from the callee of the expected type,

 - or, an error --- system-level or callee-level --- will eventually arise.

In general, the caller may not _immediately_ `await` each call.  But even in cases when they do, they use the same `async` and `await` abstractions, for the same reason: To maintain the illusion of call-return, direct-style control flow, as supported by the {proglang} compiler's transformations.

*Technical aside.* In reality, the underlying message-passing of the system forces the program's logic into another form.
Specifically, control flow around each actor method call involves the program loosing control to a system-level message-processing loop, which forces the program's logic into a so-called
_"continuation-passing-style"_ (CPS) to expose event-handling
_"callback functions"_.
This program structure is complex for humans to read and maintain, and stands in stark contrast to the direct style most prefer for most program logic.

We note that {proglang} programs may avoid callbacks for many cases, but not _all_ cases where they are used in other asynchronous, message-passing settings.
Notably, callbacks are still needed when they serve as a fundamental aspect of the service's interface, as with a link:sharing{outfilesuffix}[publish-subscribe] service, where users register with the service to get notified some times later, when some predetermined class of events, occur over time.

'''

To start, we consider the simplest stateful service: A counter with
a single "current count" value.

== Example: a Counter service

Consider the following actor object (a value form):

....
actor Counter {
  var count : Nat = 0;

  public func increment() : async () {
    count += 1;
  };

  public query func get_current() : async Nat {
    count
  };

  public func set_current(n: Nat) : async () {
    count := n;
  };
}
....

////
TODO: discuss counter example
////
== Using async to await values

To get the underlying content of an `async` value, such as a return value from `get_current` above, the caller uses `await`:

....
let a : async Nat = counter.get_current()
let c : Nat = await(counter.get_current())
....

The first line gets _a promise of the current value_ (the variable `a`), but does not wait for it, and thus cannot use it as a natural number.

The second line immediately inspects this promise and gets the natural number, or waits until it is ready.

NOTE: For now, the {proglang} compiler gives an error for calls that
do not follow this second form, which is currently required to ensure
that certain program resources will always be reclaimed.

== Actor classes generalize an actor's initial state

An actor class defines a constructor function that produces objects of a predetermined type, with a predetermined interface and behavior.

For example, we can generalize `Counter` given above to `CounterInit`
below, by introducing a constructor parameter, variable `init` of type `Nat`:

....
actor class CounterInit(init: Nat) {
  var count : Nat = init;

  public func increment() : async () {
    count += 1;
  };

  public query func get_current() : async Nat {
    count
  };

  public func set_current(n: Nat) : async () {
    count := n;
  };
}
....

To use this class, we can create several actors with different initial values:

....
let c1 = CounterInit(1);
let c2 = CounterInit(2);
....

The two lines above _instantiate_ the actor class twice, once per line.
The first invocation uses the initial value `1`, where the second uses initial value `2`.
Their interface is common, and in terms of their types, they are compatible and can be used interchangeably.

NOTE: For now, the {proglang} compiler gives an error when compiling
programs that do not consist of a single actor.
The interpreter accommodates the examples above.

== Stable and flexible variables

To enable {proglang} to persist the state of variables when a canister is upgraded, you must identify the variables that contain data that must be preserved.

You identify the variables with data that must be preserved by using the _stable_ modifier as part of the variable declarations in an actor.

Essentially, for every `+let+` and `+var+` variable declaration you define in an actor, you should specify whether the variable is a `+stable+` variable or a `+flexible+` variable. An omitted modifier defaults to `flexible`.

Concretely, you use the following syntax to declare stable or flexible variables in an actor:

```
<dec-field> ::=
  (public|private)? (stable|flexible)? dec
```

Explicitly declaring whether a variable is `+stable+` or `+flexible+` ensures the appropriate type restrictions apply.
Note that you should only use the `+stable+` or `+flexible+` modifier on `let` and `var` declarations that are **actor fields**.
You should not use the `+stable+` or `+flexible+` modifier anywhere else in your program.

The representation for stable variable signatures looks like a {proglang} actor type:

[source,motoko]
----
actor {
  stable x : Nat;
  stable var y : Int;
  stable z : [var Nat];
};
----

=== Typing

Because the compiler must ensure that stable variables are both compatible with and meaningful in the replacement program after an upgrade, the following type restrictions apply to stable state: 

* A `+stable+` declaration must have a _stable_ type. 
* Stable types are a superset of _shared_ types.
* Stable types allow objects or arrays with mutable components.

The key point to note is that stable types extend shared types to include **mutable arrays and fields**. 
Like shared types, stable types exclude ordinary functions and structures built from functions (such as objects). 
This exclusion of functions and structures built from functions is required because the meaning of a function value—consisting of both data and code—cannot be preserved across an upgrade, while the meaning of plain data—mutable or not—can be preserved.

NOTE: In general, object types are not stable because they can contain local functions. 
However, records are a special case because a record consists of fields that are stable with data that can be preserved across updates.
Actors and shared functions are also stable, allowing you to preserve their values across upgrades. For example, you can preserve values for a set of actors or callbacks subscribing to a service.

=== How stable variables are upgraded

When you first compile and deploy an actor (canister), all flexible and stable variable are initialized in sequence.
When deploy an actor (canister) as an upgrade,  all stable variables that existed in the previous version are pre-initialized with their old values.
After the stable variables are initialized with their previous values, the remaining flexible and newly-added stable variables are initialized in sequence.
