= Stable variables and upgrade methods

One key feature of the {IC} is its ability to persist canister smart contract state state using WebAssembly memory and globals rather than a traditional database. This means that
that the entire state of a canister is transparently restored before and saved after each message, without explicit user instruction.
This automatic and user-transparent preservation of state is called
_orthogonal persistence_.

Though convenient, orthogonal persistence poses a challenge when it comes to upgrading the code of a canister.
Without an explicit representation of the canister's state, how does one migrate
any application data from the retired canister to its replacement?

Accommodating upgrades without data loss requires some facility to
_migrate_ a canister's crucial data to the upgraded canister.  For example, if
you want to deploy a new version of a canister to fix an issue or add
functionality, you need to ensure that any critical canister data (such as user registrations) survives the upgrade process.

The {IC}'s persistence model allows a canister to save and restore
such data to dedicated _stable memory_ that, unlike ordinary canister
memory, is retained across an upgrade, allowing a canister to
transfer data in bulk to its replacement canister.

For applications written in {proglang}, the language provides high-level support for preserving state that leverages {IC} stable memory.
This higher-level feature, called _stable storage_, is designed to accommodate changes to both the application data and to the {proglang} compiler used to produce the application code.

Utilizing stable storage depends on you—as the application programmer—anticipating and indicating the data you want to retain after an upgrade.
Depending on the application, the data you decide to persist might be some, all, or none of a given actor's state.

////
To enable {proglang} to migrate the current state of variables when a canister is upgraded, you must identify those variables as containing data that must be preserved.
////

== Declaring stable variables

In an actor, you can nominate a variable for stable storage (in {IC} stable memory) by using the `+stable+` keyword as a modifier in the variable's declaration.

More precisely, every `+let+` and `+var+` variable declaration in an actor can specify whether the variable is `+stable+` or `+flexible+`.
If you don't provide a modifier, the variable is declared as `+flexible+` by default.

////
Concretely, you use the following syntax to declare stable or flexible variables in an actor:

....
<dec-field> ::=
  (public|private)? (stable|flexible)? dec
....
////

The following is a simple example of how to declare a stable counter
that can be upgraded while preserving the counter's value:

[source, motoko]
....
include::../examples/StableCounter.mo[]
....

////
The representation for stable variable signatures looks like a {proglang} actor type:

[source.no-repl, motoko]
....
actor {
  stable x : Nat;
  stable var y : Int;
  stable z : [var Nat];
};
....
////

NOTE: You can only use the `+stable+` or `+flexible+` modifier on `+let+` and `+var+` declarations that are **actor fields**. You cannot use these modifiers anywhere else in your program.

== Typing

Because the compiler must ensure that stable variables are both compatible with and meaningful in the replacement program after an upgrade, the following type restrictions apply to stable state:

* every `+stable+` variable must have a _stable_ type

where a type is _stable_ if the type obtained by ignoring any `var` modifiers within it is _shared_.

Thus the only difference between stable types and shared types is the former's support for mutation.
Like shared types, stable types are restricted to first-order data, excluding local functions and structures built from local functions (such as objects).
This exclusion of functions is required because the meaning of a function value — consisting of both data and code — cannot easily be preserved across an upgrade,
while the meaning of plain data — mutable or not — can be.

NOTE: In general, object types are not stable because they can contain local functions.
However, a plain record of stable data is a special case of object types that is stable.
Moreover, references to actors and shared functions are also stable, allowing you to preserve their values across upgrades.
For example, you can preserve state recording a set of actors or shared function callbacks subscribing to a service.

== How stable variables are upgraded

When you first compile and deploy a canister, all flexible and stable variables in the actor are initialized in sequence.
When you deploy a canister using the `+upgrade+` mode, all stable variables that existed in the previous version of the actor are pre-initialized with their old values.
After the stable variables are initialized with their previous values, the remaining flexible and newly-added stable variables are initialized in sequence.

== Preupgrade and postupgrade system methods

Declaring a variable to be `+stable+` requires its type to be stable too.
Since not all types are stable, some variables cannot be declared `+stable+`.

As a simple example, consider the +Registry+` actor from the discussion of link:motoko{outfilesuffix}#orthogonal_persistence[orthogonal persistence].

[source,motoko]
----
include::../examples/Registry.mo[]
----

This actor assigns sequential identifiers to `+Text+` values, using the size of the underlying `+map+` object to determine the next identifier.
Like other actors, it relies on _orthogonal persistence_ to maintain the state of the hashmap between calls.

We'd like to make the `+Register+` upgradable, without the upgrade losing any existing registrations.

Unfortunately, its state, `+map+`, has a proper object type that contains member functions (for example, `+map.get+`), so the `+map+` variable cannot, itself, be declared `+stable+`.

For scenarios like this that can't be solved using stable variables alone, {proglang} supports user-defined upgrade hooks that, when provided, run immediately before and after upgrade.
These upgrade hooks allow you to migrate state between unrestricted flexible variables to more restricted stable variables.
These hooks are declared as `+system+` functions with special names, `+preugrade+` and `+postupgrade+`. Both functions must have type `: () -> ()`.

The `+preupgrade+` method lets you make a final update to stable variables, before the runtime commits their values to {IC} stable memory, and performs an upgrade.
The `+postupgrade+` method is run after an upgrade has initialized the replacement actor, including its stable variables, but before executing any shared function call (or message) on that actor.

Here, we introduce a new stable variable, `+entries+`, to save and restore the entries of the unstable hash table.

[source,motoko]
----
include::../examples/StableRegistry.mo[]
----

Note that the type of `+entries+`, being just an array of `+Text+` and `+Nat+` pairs, is indeed a stable type.

In this example, the `+preupgrade+` system method simply writes the current `+map+` entries to `+entries+` before `+entries+` is saved to stable memory.
The `+postupgrade+` system method resets `+entries+` to the empty array after `+map+` has been populated from `+entries+` to free space.

== Upgrading the compiled program

After you have deployed a {proglang} program with the appropriate `+stable+` variables or `+preupgrade+` and `+postupgrade+` system methods, you can use the `+dfx canister install+` command with the `+--mode=upgrade+` option to upgrade the deployed code. For information about upgrading the deployed program, see link:../developers-guide/working-with-canisters{outfilesuffix}#upgrade-canister[Upgrade a canister].
