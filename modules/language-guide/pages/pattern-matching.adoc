== Chapter: Pattern matching

 - errors and optional results are special cases of pattern matching; this chapter covers all types; interested readers can jump ahead and back as needed.
  - point: unhandled errors are a special case of non-exhaustive pattern match (for results and option types)
 - point: null-pointer errors are a special case of non-exhaustive pattern match
 - the {proglang} type checker statically enforces exhaustive pattern matches for all optional types (and variants); hence, null-pointer errors are ruled out statically, and are impossible dynamically.
