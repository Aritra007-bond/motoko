= Pattern matching

Errors and optional results that are discussed in xref:errors-and-options{outfilesuffix}[Errors and optional results] represent two specific types of pattern matching.
However, there are many other ways you can use pattern matching in {proglang} programs.
This section highlights other examples of pattern matching.

  - point: unhandled errors are a special case of non-exhaustive pattern match (for results and option types)
 - point: null-pointer errors are a special case of non-exhaustive pattern match
 - the {proglang} type checker statically enforces exhaustive pattern matches for all optional types (and variants); hence, null-pointer errors are ruled out statically, and are impossible dynamically.
